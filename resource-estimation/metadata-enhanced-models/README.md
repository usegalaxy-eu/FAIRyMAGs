# Metadata Enhanced Models Tasks

## Summary
Current estimation models primarly focus on Kmer frequency. However, there are other metadata features that can be used to improve the accuracy. 
This document track explores, prototype, and test metadata-enhanced models.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Identify relevant metadata features that can enhance the estimation models.
- [ ] **Task 2**: Collect and preprocess datasets to complement Kmer frequency data with identified metadata features.
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop prototype models that integrate Kmer frequency with metadata features.
- [ ] **Task 4**: Evaluate the performance of metadata-enhanced models against baseline Kmer frequency models
