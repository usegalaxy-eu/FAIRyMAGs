# Metadata Enhanced Models Tasks

## Summary
Current estimation models primarly focus on Kmer frequency. However, there are other metadata features that can be used to improve the accuracy. 
This document track explores, prototype, and test metadata-enhanced models.

## Development 
The tasks will be developed and documentes in a series of Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks located in the `tasks/` directory. Each file will correspond to a specific task and will include code, explanations, and results.

All task are live documents and will be updated as the project progresses. **Any contributions or suggestions are welcome!**

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Identify relevant metadata features that can enhance the estimation models.
    - [X] Comepile a list of potential metadata features.
    - [X] Evaluate the feasibility of extracting these features from existing datasets.
    - [X] Prioritise features based on their potential pros and cons.
- [ ] **Task 2**: Collect and preprocess datasets to complement Kmer frequency data with identified metadata features.
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop prototype models that integrate Kmer frequency with metadata features.
- [ ] **Task 4**: Evaluate the performance of metadata-enhanced models against baseline Kmer frequency models
